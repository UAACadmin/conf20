			    		<p>The term &ldquo;art colony&rdquo; typically conjures turn-of-the-twentieth-century rural enclaves where close-knit groups of genteel white male artists assembled to escape the challenges of modern Europe and North America. Art historians Karal Ann Marling (1977) and Margaret Werth (2007) have used the phrase &ldquo;art colonizing&rdquo; to align such phenomena&mdash;groups of artists who extract value from the land and people, converting them into cultural capital for export elsewhere&mdash;with colonial processes. This session seeks to bring together scholars who explore historic and/or contemporary art colonies, cooperatives, and collectives that exist outside of this characterization. Papers might pose questions about intercultural, Indigenous, ethnic, immigrant, religious, regional, or international groups of artists; practices that recover and decolonize the land; collaborative art, design, and craft production; shared political ideas and activism; common financial systems, patronage, and academic or other institutional ties; mobility; or even unproductive art colonies. We welcome papers about different materials, geographies, and theoretical approaches.</p>

			    		<h3>C.9.1 <i>The Old Masters and Gendered Spaces: The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos and the &lsquo;Rembrandt Room&rsquo; at Stowe</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Andrea Morgan</strong><span class="school">, PhD Candidate, Queen&rsquo;s University</span></p>
	    				<p>The history of collecting Rembrandt&rsquo;s pictures in England is a subject of continual scholarly interest. However, just as there has long been an often-exclusionary canon of Western European artists, the same is generally true of those who collected their artworks. Indeed, historians so often turn to wealthy male aristocrats like Horace Walpole, or to celebrated artist-collectors such as Sir Joshua Reynolds in these sorts of pursuits, myself included. While there is undoubted value to this work, my paper will instead address certain underrepresented groups who are emerging from the margins of history &mdash; namely women, along with those outside the elite upper classes &mdash; by considering some of the ways that they too engaged with the fine arts.</p>
	    				<p>In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos amassed an impressive collection of paintings and sculpture at Stowe house, Buckinghamshire. This included eleven pictures attributed to Rembrandt, making it one of the largest private collections of his work in England at that time. Yet, these pictures soon came to be displayed as a group in the Duchess&rsquo;s dressing room, or the so-called &lsquo;Rembrandt Room&rsquo; at Stowe. This odd choice is striking: why hang all of your &lsquo;Rembrandts&rsquo; in the Duchess&rsquo;s room and not a dining room or parlor, as was most common? Was it at the Duchess&rsquo; request and, if so, why did they appeal to her? And what does it mean to dedicate a specifically female and semi-private space to a collection of old masters? I will attempt an answer to these queries before moving on to briefly discuss early modern working-class Londoners who purchased and commissioned art during this period, and the difficult question of whether or not there was a certain aesthetic or artist who may have appealed to &lsquo;middle-class taste.'</p>

			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Isabel Luce</strong><span class="school">, PhD Candidate, Queen&rsquo;s University</span></p>
		    			<p>In the early 1920s, Canadian-born collector and decorator Kate Reed (1856-1928) wrote about the affective power of the furniture she collected:</p>
		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col s10 offset-s1 m8 offset-m1 l5 offset-l2">
		    			<p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;[i]t is through its power to give back the past, and the quickening touch it lays on memory, recalling a sentiment here, a tragedy there, that makes furniture command our interest and our affection.&rdquo;</i></p>
		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col s12 m10 l7 offset-l1">
		    			<p>Her book-length manuscript <i>My Possessions</i> serves as a love note to her faithful inanimate friends who accompanied her from home to home throughout her life. These collected possessions had heartbeats and lives, and her own interactions with them would leave further impressions on the objects. Reed detailed innumerable trips to antique shops (sometimes accompanied by friends and fellow collectors such as Ada Yates in Quebec City and Sir William Cornelius Van Horne in Montreal), on which she used her expert eye to seek out valuable treasures amidst piles of rubbish. Gaining clout for her sense of style and good taste, Reed was hired to decorate the interiors of prestigious hotels and lodges along the Canadian Pacific Railway, railway stations, chalets and homes around Canada, and was widely considered Canada&amp;rsquo;s first interior decorator.</p>
		    			<p>Kate Reed&rsquo;s granddaughter Kate Armour Reed published the definitive biographical account of Reed&rsquo;s life in 2016 called <i>A Woman&rsquo;s Touch: Kate Reed and Canada&rsquo;s Grand Hotels</i> (2016). My paper builds on the recent biographical work of Kate Reed&rsquo;s granddaughter, Kate Armour Reed, closely examining <i>My Possessions</i> to analyze Reed&rsquo;s understanding of her personal relationship to objects in the context of her role as a settler colonialist, upper-class, white woman collector. Reed&rsquo;s aesthetic choices in her collecting practices, largely informed by European design trends, and her placement of these affective collected objects in the very public spaces of hotel lobbies helped to shape what would be considered a Canadian colonial national look.</p>

			    		<h3>C.9.3 <i>Large-scale Artifacts, Small-scale Evidence The Dilemma of Documentation</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Dr. Bonne Zabolotney</strong><span class="school">, Associate Professor, ECUAD</span></p>
	    				<p>Using the work of Andrew King and King Show Prints as a case study, this presentation grapples with developing an understanding of historical large-scale graphic design work through a small-scale frame of reference, and the responsibility of the researcher to make historical work relevant to design practitioners. Andrew King, a printer, master carver, and proto-designer who practiced in Saskatchewan during the first half of the 20th century produced work at an unprecedented scale. His posters for circuses and other spectacles were printed at sizes large enough to cover the sides of barns, yet very little of his work was documented in context during its time. King also printed large dates, numbers, and other information to accompany existing posters, and some of these figures were carved and printed up to 7 feet in height.</p>
	    				<p>Very few photos exist of King&rsquo;s work in context, and they often display tiny and imperfect examples of his posters on sides of buildings, leaving design culture scholars to research King&rsquo;s monumental work through extremely small documentation. These photos are also in black and white, leaving viewers to speculate the impact that colour and scale had on the average viewer. We can also view some of King&rsquo;s original large prints in several gallery collections and archives, but this leaves us with pieces or examples of the letterforms out of context. Witnessing the large scale work at actual size and in situ seems to be an impossibility, and yet this would provide a profound understanding of large-scale work and its impact to contemporary design practices. How can scholars contend with the dilemma of studying this work in context, but with small and imprecise documentation, or at full size but without context? How can contemporary designers learn from this historical work?</p>
