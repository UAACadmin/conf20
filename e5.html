			    		<p>Modernism has held a complicated position towards Indigenous and African forms. In Canada and the United States, cultural products were copied for their aesthetically &quot;primitive&quot; inspirations or stood in for &quot;disappearing&quot; populations. Throughout Latin America, artists turned to such forms to establish the legitimacy of &lsquo;genuine&rsquo; identities or to forge ideals in newly industrializing nations.</p>
						<p>What lies at the center of these tactics is the employment of marginalized bodies, propped up by the integration of cultural forms and techniques of Indigenous, First Nations and/or African nations. This panel aims to recuperate histories that went ignored or were erased under the twentieth-century modernist and vanguard movements. We invite contributions that consider how Afro and Indigenous artists re-appropriated or altered &quot;modern&quot; forms to counter colonial narratives, as well as papers analyzing artists and/or movements in the Americas that were overlooked within a hegemonic legacy of modernism.</p>

			    		<h3>E.5.1 <i>Gender, Race, and Style in the work of Cecilia Marcovich (1894-1976)</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Georgina G. Gluzman</strong><span class="school">, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient&iacute;ficas y T&eacute;cnicas</span></p>
	    				<p>Painter, sculptor, and educator, Cecilia Marcovich was born in Romania and moved with her family to Argentina as a child. After her initial training in the city of Rosario, she went to Paris to complete her education with Antoine Bourdelle, Andr&eacute; Lothe, Charles Despiau and Paul Baudo&uuml;in. In 1931, Cecilia Marcovich returned from Paris and settled in Buenos Aires. A few years later, she founded an art school, the Asociaci&oacute;n Pl&aacute;stica Argentina, which provided art education to several generations of artists. She made several trips through Argentina and Brazil. There she began a series of paintings and sculptures that deal with Afro-Brazilian population. This series offers a deep exploration of a marginalized group, which was often employed in the development of modern languages as the mere object of representation. I argue that Marcovich&rsquo;s point of view, informed by her political beliefs, presented these subjects in their complexity. Her critical fortune is inextricably linked to the criticism the style she devoted herself to, a modern figurative language, and to her focus on theses topics, largely ignored by traditional narratives.</p>

			    		<h3>E.5.2 <i>Challenging White Cultural Hegemony from Within: Afro-Cuban Figurative Art Between 1940-58</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Cary Aileen Garc&iacute;a Yero</strong><span class="school">, Harvard University</span></p>
	    				<p>This paper explains the ways in which Afro-Cuban artists such as Ramon Loy, Ramos Blanco, and Uver Sol&iacute;s mobilized modernist figurative art techniques to navigate Cuba&rsquo;s race relations during the Second Republic (1940-58). The ambiguous historical context in which these artists worked persistently silenced racial inequality and took for granted the hegemony of Western culture while problematically embracing <i>lo negro</i> as Cuban. These black artists did not reject European art; instead, they embraced the capaciousness of European art for their professional development. The paper explains the ways in which they challenged white cultural hegemony from within and asserted ideals of black autonomy within the island hegemonic ideological context of racial harmony. In doing so, this work illuminates on their significant yet unrecognized artistic contributions, understanding them in their own terms as part of the larger map of black artistic production.</p>

			    		<h3>E.5.3 <i>Rereading Abstraction in Latin America: Wilfredo Lam, Fernando de Szyszio, Francisco Matto and the Afro-Amerindian Paradigm</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Elena O&rsquo;Neill</strong><span class="school">, Universidad Cat&oacute;lica del Uruguay</span></p>
	    				<p>The hegemonic legacy of modernist art history and theory frequently inhibit other approaches to the art of the Americas; even if there is a certain recognition, the prefix pre as in Pre-Columbian or Pre-Hispanic often imply a perennial otherness, not to mention the bifurcation between North and Latin America, modernist and Amerindian abstraction, the modernist dilemma of abstraction/figuration and how historiography dealt with these issues.</p>
	    				<p>A series of flat wooden sculptures set in a natural environment, which Francisco Matto called Totems, dialogue with the geometric abstraction of modern art while recovering the Amerindian heritage of the continent, where myth and ritual are closely intertwined. These figures reintroduce the notion of form in terms of psychic function, connecting man with a reality beyond reason. Trained under Academic guidelines, Wifredo Lam found in the art of Picasso a formal liberation from an academic tradition; but to analyse Lam&rsquo;s works as from this bias is to affirm that his artistic identity was shaped by the same influences that constituted the European avant-garde. What if we analyse Lam&rsquo;s work as from his return to Cuba in 1941, considering a transcultural Caribbean and its literary avant-garde? Fernando de Szyszlo&rsquo;s works, and the titles of his works, endorse an indigenous cosmovision beyond the prevailing thematic indigenism of the time. Instead of contemplating and describing reality, Szyszlo entered an indigenous psychic matrix, establishing a creative dialogue between modernity and ancestrality that guides us into a mythic past which somehow we acknowledge us as ours. This paper aims to revisit the works of these artists as from an Afro-Amerindian paradigm, to think the term &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; as constructed on America&rsquo;s often forgotten roots and to acknowledge abstraction as a necessary step in the symbol-shaping process.</p>

			    		<h3>E.5.4 <i>Chasing the Invisiblized Heritage. Contemporary Artists and Photographers in Search of Afro-Argentinian Vestiges and Forms of Resistance in Argentinian Art and Culture</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Katarzyna Cytlak</strong><span class="school">, Independent Researcher</span></p>
	    				<p>Not only the visibility but also the most basic recognition is nowadays the main issue for citizens of Afro-Argentinian descent. When in Brazil and in Uruguay the impact of Afro-American cultural heritage is still marginalized, but not questioned &ndash; the Afro-Brazilian Museum functions in S&atilde;o Paulo since 2004; the <i>Casa de la Cultura Afrouruguaya</i> (the Afro-Uruguayan Cultural House) in Montevideo organizes several exhibitions devoted to art and history of local communities &ndash; its condition in Argentina is much more precarious. The particularity of the political and socio-cultural situation in which Afro-Argentinians defend their cultural heritage is the lack of any official institutional support. The lack of museum structures results from a common belief that Afro-Argentinians once existed &ndash; they left their traces still perceptible in tango culture &ndash; but they had disappeared.</p>
	    				<p>This paper will question the persistence in Latin American discourse on art and culture of patterns from the colonial past, as defined by the <i>coloniality of power (colonialidad del poder)</i>, the key analytical category in the Latin American debate on the postcolonial condition, which was developed in the 1990s by Peruvian sociologist An&iacute;bal Quijano. It proposes to emphasize artistic activity by the Argentinian photographer Nicol&aacute;s Parodi who, in collaboration with the Association Diafar (Di&aacute;spora Africana de la Argentina &ndash; Association of the African Diaspora in Argentina) and the Espacio Malcolm (the Afro-Argentinian Cultural Center) search to <i>&ldquo;fill an aesthetic and visual gap&rdquo;</i> in Argentinian cultural and artistic consciousness and to visibilize the traces of African and afro-Argentinian heritage in art, culture, and national history. We will tend to analyze the strategies of Parodi&rsquo;s photographs as with the images designed for the review <i>El Afroargentino</i> edited by Espacio Malcolm.</p>
