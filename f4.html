			    		<p>This two-part session invites BIPOC and White Settler scholars, artists and curators into dialogue concerning the ways artistic production interjects disturbance into contemporary colonial landscapes transnationally. A geography of colonial ideology overlays all aspects of contemporary life in nations and bodies impacted by settler colonialism. This extends from normative conceptions of place and identity within the settler society to the calcified institutional administrative cultures that shape engagement with, and the production of, knowledge. The arts and cultural sector has been complicit in establishing and maintaining dominant imaginaries and structures that sustain these sometimes painful ideological landscapes. Simultaneously, cultural workers are often instrumental in subverting them. Through a discussion of specific artworks, the roundtable participants will consider how artistic interventions mobilize &ldquo;radical defamiliarization&rdquo; (States 2010, 35) as a strategy for disturbing colonial whiteness and asserting unremitting Indigenous sovereignties in the land, the gallery and iconic national sites.</p>

			    		<h3>F.4.1 <i>Deanna Bowen: Notes from</i> The Gods of Gods: Berlin, Berlin <i>and</i> Black Drones in the Hive</h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Deanna Bowen</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
	    				<p>My presentation involves self-reflection and presentation of two interdependent exhibitions presented at the 2020 Berlin Biennale and the Kitchener Waterloo Art Gallery September 18 &ndash; February 28, 2021. Respectively, <i>The God of Gods: Berlin, Berlin</i> and <i>Black Drones in the Hive</i> extend critical interventionist research of the White nationalist ambitions that inform Canada&rsquo;s cultural history and national narrative. Specifically, <i>The God of Gods: Berlin, Berlin</i> is an off-site companion work to <i>Black Drones in the Hive</i> that examines the history of Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener) and Berlin, Germany during WWI as a means to reveal the familial, geographic, cultural, and colonial entanglements between the British Commonwealth, Germany, Canada, the United States, and Africa from the mid 1700s. <i>Black Drones</i> is a solo exhibition that looks at the regional histories surrounding the Kitchener Waterloo Art Gallery and greater Southern Ontario. The project looks at Six Nations history and the terms of the Haldimand Proclamation of 1784, which refers to Quebec&rsquo;s Governor Sir Frederick Haldimand granting a tract of land to Mohawk Chief Thayendanegea&rsquo;s (Joseph Brant) and the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) for their alliance with the British during the American Revolution 1765-83. Accordingly, the American Revolution provides an opportunity to then reflect on a long, traumatic history of prolonged conflict that continues in the War of 1812-15, the US Civil War (1861-65), the Boer War (1899-1902), and World War I (1914-1918). <i>Black Drones...</i> is also an investigative process of production that works to excavate Black presence and erasure. Archival documents from the mid 1700s attest to African-American slave presence in both British and Six Nations communities. Other materials reveal a robust black presence in the region, with a population of 60,000 in 1900. The quandary of this growth is its extraordinary decline to 18,000 by 1920 and so my research digs deeper into regional Ontario history to trace the ways that this decline is commingle with local, national and global preoccupations with Eugenics and population control.</p>

Bowen’s family history has been the central pivot of her auto-ethnographic interdisciplinary works since the early 1990s. She makes use of a repertoire of artistic gestures in order to define the Black body and trace its presence and movement in place and time. In recent years, her work has involved close examination of her family’s migration and their connections to Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Black Strathcona, the “All-Black” towns of Oklahoma, the Kansas Exoduster migrations and the Ku Klux Klan in Canada and the US.

			    		<h3>F.4.2 <i>Virgil Ortiz and the Reimagining of Sci-Fi Futurities</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Nicole Neidhardt</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
	    				<p>My presentation will introduce the work of Cochiti Pueblo artist, Virgil Ortiz and his <i>Revolt 1680/2180</i> series. This series of work powerfully subverts, questions, and reclaims histories in what is now known as the southwest United States. Within the realm of Indigenous Futurisms, Ortiz is able to &ldquo;radically defamiliarize&rdquo; viewers with colonial histories that shape our current lived realities as Indigenous peoples. Oritiz&rsquo;s work engages in sci-fi tropes while simultaneously critiquing historical notions of what sci-fi is. Sci-fi has long been a roadmap for colonial futures. It has shaped the aesthetic of the future and in doing so has contributed to a dominant settler imaginary that thrives on exploration, extraction, violence, and displacement. Through a critical analysis of Virgil Ortiz&rsquo;s work we can see how he disrupts western colonial notions of futurities and reasserts Indigenous sovereignty, connection to land, and relationality. This disruption, and reimagining of possible futures resists dominant narratives and offers alternative pathways to collective futures and present realities. Indigenous Futurisms has the ability to call into motion the worlds of Indigenous ancestors before colonial contact and project this abundance without adversity into our present, and into possible futures.</p>

			    		<h3>F.4.3 <i>Embodying Treaty: Lorraine Albert’s</i> Steps Forward</h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Carla Taunton</strong><span class="school">, NSCAD University</span></p>
	    				<p>I propose to introduce the installation <i>Steps Forward</i> (2017) by white-settler artist Lorraine Albert. This work is a site-specific intervention which exemplifies &lsquo;radical defamiliarization&rsquo; in that it aims to interrupt the experience of walkers visiting the iconic Skyline trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park. This project, grounded in critical settler methodologies, aims to actively assert Mi&rsquo;kmaw sovereignty and remembrance of treaty protocols by featuring 35 plates of brass metal on the 35 steps of the trail that were laser-etched with original text from the Treaties of Peace and Friendship signed in 1752 between the Mi&rsquo;kmaw Nation and the British Crown. Albert&rsquo;s installation exposes the erasure of Mi&rsquo;kmaw land sovereignty in the national park. It also challenges settler imaginary of wilderness and settler possession of land by marking the trail with treaty text serving as evidence of unsurrendered Indigenous territory. These treaties were meant to establish protocols of co-existence and shared accountabilities grounded in Mi&rsquo;kmaw epistemologies and ontologies. I will situate Albert&rsquo;s Steps Forward as a critical settler decolonial strategy of what I call &ldquo;embodying treaty&rdquo; &ndash; a methodology that invites settlers to be accountable to treaty responsibilities as guests on sovereign Indigenous territories and that is responsive to and non-cooptive of local land based and cultural knowledges.</p>

			    		<h3>F.4.4 <i>Dressing Indigenous Sovereignty: A Critical Analysis on Dismantling Whiteness within Fashion Studies</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Justine Woods</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
	    				<p>Fashion as an ideology, as an industry and as a space of study is itself an Institution. It is a constructed colonial landscape that spans the earth&rsquo;s edges on a global scale. This conversation will enable space for a critical analysis on the need to center Indigenous ways of knowing in relationship to Land within Fashion Studies to subvert and disrupt colonial ideologies and narratives that have continuously controlled Indigenous bodies and identities. Acknowledging the discourse of whiteness within Fashion Studies, this critical analysis will inform new thinking on how Indigenous Fashion promotes the mobilization of Indigenous bodies, Land sovereignty and cultural resurgence through methods of design and dress. Direct examples of garment-based works by Indigenous designers will be used and analyzed to support this research, thinking and conversation. This critical analysis will enable a space of representation and assertion of Indigenous sovereignty within Fashion and will aid in dismantling Fashion as a constructed ideology purely associated with Western culture.</p>
