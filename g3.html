			    		<p>The idea of borders has been linked to military concepts ever since it was first mentioned in the 11th century on the Iberian Peninsula and is constantly interwoven within power relationships. Globalized by colonialism and imperialism, it takes nowadays the institutionalized cartographic form of a line separating different political entities. It implies the idea of ​​an opposition, a "front" necessary to protect an interior space from an external threat. Borders can take physical forms and sometimes follow natural geographic lines, but often do not take into account the topographic and geopolitical realities of the territory in question, rather serving an external power. There is also the question of maritime spaces: does water belong to all individuals, or can it be territorialized the same way terrestrial spaces are? The semantic field of the word border is wide, therefore we invite all papers, in French and English, on the topics of representations of borders over time, as well as the past and current problematics resulting from these representations.</p>

			    		<h3>G.3.1 <i>Ordering the State: Inner and Outer Borders in Chinese Maps from the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279)</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Julia Orell</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
	    				<p>China&rsquo;s Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) was a time of intense engagement with geography, especially historical geography, resulting in the production of a wealth of printed materials. Maps are included in illustrated local and regional gazetteers, atlases show the Chinese empire throughout history, and discussions of ancient geographical treatises use maps to make arguments about the interpretation of textual information. My paper explores if and how borders were represented in a selection of these materials by examining both the outer borders of the Chinese empire and the internal borders between administrative units (circuits, provinces, counties).</p> 
	    				<p>Cartographic representations did not follow a standardized set of conventions at the time, so that different modes of representing borders &ndash; or not showing them at all &ndash; co-existed, which speaks to a more fluid notion of &ldquo;border&rdquo; than found in modern cartography. While clearly demarcated, linear borders were essential during this time of military conflicts with neighbor states and subject to complex negotiations, maps are often ambiguous about showing and locating borders. For instance, depictions of the Great Wall in maps served as an &ldquo;imaginary&rdquo; northern border that did not correspond to a built structure or actual state borders. In addition to printed maps, my paper also discusses a twelfth-century handscroll painting that depicts the upper reaches of the Yangzi River in Sichuan province with inscribed place names. This painting includes &ldquo;demarcations&rdquo; of administrative borders (between counties) in textual form, floating in an undefined space above the river scenery. By examining these Song dynasty cartographic materials, I argue that the notion of border shifted, depending on the type of map, its intended audience, and political agenda.</p>

			    		<h3>G.3.2 <i>Outposts, Arteries and Borders: A Mapping of Rural Saskatchewan Grain Elevators</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Elizabeth Whalley</strong><span class="school">, Visual Artist</span></p>
	    				<p>The iconic image of the grain elevator silhouetted against an empty sky embodies a certain unbounded vision of the Canadian west. For this session about the representation of borders in cartography, I will present a map whose borders frame and compartmentalize a vast imperialized and colonized region stretching from the eastern border of Alberta to the western shore of the Great Lakes and that includes what we now know as Saskatchewan. The map&rsquo;s network of borders implicates outpost grain elevators, arteries of railways, as well as various political and geographic borders. Borders on my map suggest that they can be ephemeral, arbitrary, and fuzzy. Territories of indigenous people, the Medicine Line, boundaries of ghost towns, abandoned railway lines and the definition of geographical ecosystems defy permanent and precisely drawn borders. The narrative of the colonial history that the map and its web of signifiers unpack about the isolated grain elevator becomes likewise blurred and ambiguous.</p> 
	    				<p>The process of mapping gives me, as an artist, a way to dig into the meanings behind the aesthetics of the individual elevator and dramatic western spaces. By changing my perspective from the &ldquo;street view&rdquo; of the grain elevator against the sky to the disembodied surveillance perspective of &ldquo;satellite view,&rdquo; I transform a personal impression into an analysis of ongoing natural and man-made systems. By drawing borders that quantify and categorize ecosystems, regions of exploitation, and points of control I call up issues of territorialization, ownership, and political power. Through mapping I infiltrate the disciplines of geography, economics, and history to show that not only grain elevators of rural Saskatchewan, but also the communities that depended on them, and the railways that connected them to Eastern markets, are a part of the armature of colonization used in the process of creating the Canadian state.</p>

			    		<h3>G.3.3 <i>Art of Joyful Activism: Tom&aacute;s Saraceno&rsquo;s Work for the Environment and a World without Borders</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Joyce Anitagrace</strong><span class="school">, University of Maryland Baltimore County</span></p>
	    				<p>Tom&aacute;s Saraceno is an artist who stages spectacular floating and interactive artworks around the world, using renewable energy. Saraceno was born in Argentina yet as a toddler his family was forced to leave and spend a decade in exile in Italy due to the dictatorship that was responsible for the murder, &ldquo;disappearance,&rdquo; torture, and exile of tens of thousands of people. When the dictatorship ended, and his parents spoke of returning &ldquo;home,&rdquo; Saraceno experienced what so many displaced people around the world feel: a sense of not belonging to any particular place.</p> 
	    				<p>Saraceno&rsquo;s artwork begins with old technologies (the hot air balloon, experiments with the flight behavior of tetrahedrons) and &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; (such as spider webs), found by studying the natural world, and transforms them into projects such as floating cities that reimagine the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere as a place for all to travel freely while also building community. His <i>Aerocene</i>, for example, transforms plastic bag waste into balloons powered by the sun that lift people into the air, literally giving them a new perspective. Saraceno states that this work, &ldquo;is an open invitation to all who wish to participate&rdquo; in the artwork, but more radically, to participate in a new way of belonging, &ldquo;an invitation to form independent communities anywhere in the world.&rdquo; He took his <i>Aerocene</i> project to the Salar de Uyuni of Bolivia, a place threatened by pollution and of incredible natural beauty where the sky is reflected in the salt flats with such clarity that one feels as though they are floating among the stars. Saraceno&rsquo;s work is sustainable because it is based in joy, wonder, and interconnectedness. We may have been cut off from what was once our home. We may be alienated from the world due to environmental degradation, racism, and anti-immigrant ideology. We may feel that we do not belong anywhere and yet, as Saraceno&rsquo;s work demonstrates, we can choose to create connection: we belong to the entire world.</p>
