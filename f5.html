		    		<p>The theme of this session is art and activism in Latin America. Art and activism are two distinct academic disciplines, but ones which can dialogue and merge into action, which ranges from cultural production to a mutual understanding of contemporary political and social changes. We will therefore look at Latin America contemporary artists whose work blends art and activism. Artists in different contexts and Latin America countries have increasingly positioned themselves in situations of political and social change, from climate change to human rights. The current political crises, the coronavirus crises and the consequences to the global economy, as well as the social struggles that lead to large influxes of Latin America migrants into the United States, have already inspired many. Further examples to be deepened in this research are the works that focus on refugees fleeing political persecution, Latin America protest art, social injustices, resistance, art and politics.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.1 <i>Community, Activism, Intellectual and Artistic Experience in the First Phase of TAI (1974-78)</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Brian Smith Hudson</strong><span class="school">, Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico</span></p>
    				<p>In 1974, students of the Aesthetics Class led by the theoretician Alberto H&iacute;jar of the FFyL-UNAM, began the Taller de Arte e Ideolog&iacute;a group (TAI), one of the most prolific and complex collectives of the Mexican &quot;Generation of Groups&quot; from the 1970s. The relationship between theory and practice at TAI was fundamental. It was the political and intellectual searches of each member that arise the collective's methodology. These were linked to the development of theory and practical work based on applied knowledge about its own historicity and context, which demanded the ideological position of its members. Together they highlighted the collective work and the capacity for discuss and approach from Marxist theory, all the political and social phenomena that occurred in their presents. This intellectual and artistic community understood by Roberto Esposito as a &ldquo;debt&rdquo; between his partners, strategies of rupture half-opened towards the domain of the Mexican political and artistic institutionality.</p>
					<p>Thus is why I propose to analyze the actions carried out during the first phase of the TAI (1974-78), in order to glimpse the implications that the notion of artistic activism and community had in them, approached by Marcelo Exp&oacute;sito, Ana Vidal and Jaime Vindel (in one hand), and Roberto Esposito (in the other), to identify and value the intellectual, activist and artistic production of the group. In specific, I am interested in looking at how and from what positionalities this group emerged; what dynamics characterized TAI&rsquo;s first phase; what factors influenced the creation of this collective and shaped its relationship with art, aesthetics in and from the academic space.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.2 <i>Hecho en Cuba, Heard Around the World: Local and Global Performative Srategies for Socio-Political Artivism by Tania Bruguera</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Felicia Franca Leu</strong><span class="school">, Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Montr&eacute;al</span></p>
    				<p><i>&ldquo;That one day freedom of expression in Cuba will not be a performance&ldquo;</i> describes the artivist approach of the work of Cuban artist, Tania Bruguera, in a nutshell. By expanding the idea of performance, Bruguera uses social spaces to empower her spectators in order to initiate change to effectively fight against human rights violations by the Cuban government. Through her performance Tatlin&rsquo;s <i>Whisper #6</i> (2009), Bruguera gave her audience a moment of free speech at Centro Wifredo Lam, Havana. In 2014, she attempted to restage this piece on Revolution Square in Havana, but was arrested multiple times, accused of stimulating public disturbance, and thus the performance was prevented.</p>
    				<p>The following research will explore two artivistic strategies that Bruguera uses to initiate socio-political change via creative protest: (1) The engagement of the present, Cuban audience in her artivist performances by providing a platform to the participants, thereby trying to create a community who is speaking up for the same values, (2) The implication of her global community who she is addressing virtually. Bruguera uses her international attention in combination with the new condition of hypervisibility of digital technology to raise awareness about violations of human rights in her home country: Via digital media, she is informing the public about her dissident arrests, intimidation and harassment from the Cuban State, in this framework also referring to the performative movement <i>#YOTAMBIENEXIJO</i> (2014-ongoing). Proposing this specific case study on artist Tania Bruguera and on her Western reception through mediation will underline the continuing absence of &lsquo;other&rsquo; Cuban artivists in Western discourse. Therefore, the contribution at hand aims to close with a brief commentary on this continuation, thus questioning the Western way of storytelling Cuban performance art.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.3 <i>EXTRACOLONIAL: Reflections for Action</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Noor Al&eacute; &amp; Claudia Mattos</strong><span class="school">, independent curators</span></p>
    				<p><i>EXTRACOLONIAL: Reflections for Action</i> is an essay that was written to accompany an exhibition of the same name presented at Sur Gallery/Latin American-Canadian Art Projects in Toronto (February 12 to April 4, 2020). Reflecting on the centuries-long history of natural resource extraction in the Americas, the essay and exhibition brought together a group of Indigenous and Latin American artists &ndash; Ulysses Castellanos, Monica Gutierrez Quintero, Yoshua Ok&oacute;n, and Onaman Collective &ndash; whose works examine the relationship between extractivism and colonialism in a long and violent legacy of resource exploitation. These works propose alternate activist models to address the sustained systems of inequality seeded in this legacy, including the uneven movement of capital, expropriation of Indigenous ancestral lands, deterioration of the natural landscape, and instances of civil unrest. The title of this essay and exhibition married the terms extractivism and colonialism to evoke their inextricable relationship, nodding towards the deep and insidious roots of this union throughout the Americas. The subtitle is borrowed from Alberto Acosta&rsquo;s article <i>Post-Extractivism: From Discourse to Practice &mdash; Reflections for Action</i>, an activist manifesto that proposes new ways of living with and within the land to undo the grip of extractivism from Latin America&rsquo;s various economies. Acosta, the former Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines, advocates for the implementation of widespread socio-environmental reform to protect undeveloped, natural environments and the legal interests and socio-economic needs of those peoples whose ways of life are placed into jeopardy by extractive activities. These conditions shape a constellation of conflicts and financial agendas that place into jeopardy the humanitarian, economic, and environmental well-being of primarily Indigenous communities across the two continents. Looking beyond policy and approaching art as activism, the works examined in this essay and exhibition expose entrenched systems of oppression, putting forward strategies to undermine extractive profiteering and the colonial apparatus.</p>
