			    		<p>This panel seeks to draw together diverse practices to collectively imagine art and design research as a reciprocal engagement with materials. This may include an emphasis on ecologies of extraction and application, or exploratory processes that recognize material agency within creative practice. In the development and application of material palettes, innovative methodologies emerge through an interrogation of process. How can the &ldquo;materialist turn&rdquo; in art and design inform an integrated and ecologically sound perspective within the methodologies of creation and application? In the shift to ecologically sound materials, can we avoid the pitfalls of exploitation and extraction that are the driving forces of our current capitalist economy? This panel will invite interdisciplinary conversations that seek to transgress the silos between art and design by foregrounding notions of reciprocity in material ecologies of research and creation.</p>
