			    		<p>The theme of this session is art and activism in Latin America. Art and activism are two distinct academic disciplines, but ones which can dialogue and merge into action, which ranges from cultural production to a mutual understanding of contemporary political and social changes. We will therefore look at Latin America contemporary artists whose work blends art and activism. Artists in different contexts and Latin America countries have increasingly positioned themselves in situations of political and social change, from climate change to human rights. The current political crises, the coronavirus crises and the consequences to the global economy, as well as the social struggles that lead to large influxes of Latin America migrants into the United States, have already inspired many. Further examples to be deepened in this research are the works that focus on refugees fleeing political persecution, Latin America protest art, social injustices, resistance, art and politics.</p>

	    				<p>October 2, 2008 marked the 40-year anniversary of Mexico City&rsquo;s 1968 student movement and its violent repression by the state. As part of the commemoration, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer&rsquo;s participatory installation <i>Voz Alta</i> shone over the city. Lozano-Hemmer and his production team installed a modified megaphone on a stand in Tlatelolco Square. The artist invited the public to say what they would, and a computer system &ldquo;translated&rdquo; the rhythm and volume of each speaker&rsquo;s voice into flashes from four massive searchlights. Voz Alta projected beams of light across the city in honor of 1968.</p>
						<p>While <i>Voz Alta</i> has been flatly celebrated as a participatory platform for &ldquo;free speech,&rdquo; I pay close attention to the aesthetics of this platform, showing that it forecloses speech in a number of key ways. It also anchored the memory of 1968 comfortably in Tlatelolco Square, allowing the gentrification of Mexico City&rsquo;s Centro Hist&oacute;rico to go on, unbothered by this history. In contrast, I argue that itinerant artworks by the artist collective Teatro Ojo refused such a nostalgic homecoming. Instead, they wandered Mexico City&rsquo;s streets, rode its busses, and visited its historic sites. In so doing, they escaped from the canonical timelines and territories of the student movement, making 1968 appear in unsuspecting times and places. Their playful, looping approach to history offers a model for activist engagement in the past.</p>

	    				<p>Coal extracted from Curanilahue, a commune in the south of Chile (B&iacute;o B&iacute;o Region), serves as the main sculpting material for Alejandra Prieto (Santiago de Chile, 1980-). Her work turns extractivism and class struggle two of the main sovereign issues when describing the present political moment in Chile. A wall-wide framed mirror, a chandelier lamp, a pair of Nike sports-shoes, or a Le Corbusier Chase Longue are just some of the objects Prieto has made out of coal and exhibited in solo and collective exhibitions since 2005. Traditional notions of taste, design, class, work, and race are problematized in her work. This contribution aims at presenting Prieto&acute;s proposal trying to establish relationships between art, production, and politics in Chile.</p>

			    		<h3>D.5.3 <i>Fighting Neoliberalism: The New York Solidarity Network with Chile</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Florencia San Mart&iacute;n</strong><span class="school">, California State University, San Bernadino</span></p>
	    				<p>On October 18, 2019, massive protests erupted in Chile, inaugurating the biggest social uprising since the end of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship (1973–90). Coined as Chile’s &quot;estallido social&quot; (social outbreak), an unprecedented number of art workers and activists took to the streets, to demand the end of the neoliberal model-imported for the first time transnationally into Chile during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime under the advice of US economist Milton Friedman. But to be sure, demands regarding the end the neoliberal project in Chile developed from the realm of art and culture are nothing new; nor are solidarity groups supporting these demands in the global context. In the U.S. for instance, an important artistic solidarity network developed immediately after the coup, critiquing the catastrophic relationship between the newly installed dictatorship and the neoliberal model. This presentation is about this solidarity network and focused more specifically in artistic practices developed from New York through the work of cultural practitioners including, among others, U.S. art writer Dore Ashton, Newyorican photographer Maximo Colon, and Chilean former ambassador to the U.S., Orlando Letelier. In unearthing these artistic practices that included, among other forms, public interventions, mural making, performative protests, and memorials, this presentation&rsquo;s aims is twofold. First, it seeks to connect historically, culturally, and politically the current &quot;estallido social&quot; in Chile with a longer and larger history of anti-neoliberal demands made from the front of the visual arts not only in Chile but within a hemispheric context. And secondly, from the starting point of the visual arts as a form of activism, it advances in recent scholarly efforts in the field of memory studies regarding the understanding of memory within transnational and anti-capitalist scopes.</p>

			    		<h3>D.5.4 <i>Depicting Exodus in Contemporary Latin America: Beatriz Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo;s</i> Zulia, Zulia, Zulia</h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Mart&iacute;n Ruiz Mendoza</strong><span class="school">, University of Michigan</span></p>
	    				<p>According to the United Nations, 2.6 million Venezuelans have migrated since 2014 to other countries in South America, mainly due to violence, hyperinflation and food and medicine shortage in their home country. Only Colombia is sheltering 1 million Venezuelans, and projections indicate that 4 million could be living there by 2021. This state of affairs brings to mind a question posed by Homi Bhaba in his introduction to <i>The Location of Culture</i>, namely,</p>
		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col s10 offset-s1 m8 offset-m1 l5 offset-l2">
			    		<p class="quote"><i>"How do strategies of representation or empowerment come to be formulated in the competing claims of communities where, despite shared histories of deprivation and discrimination, the exchange of values, meanings, and priorities may not always be collaborative and dialogical, but may be profoundly antagonistic, conflictual and even incommensurable?”</i> (2).</p>
		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col s12 m10 l7 offset-l1">
		    		 	<p>The way in which the Venezuelan migration crisis has been politically exploited by the political elite in Colombia fully evinces the antagonism posited by Bhaba. This calls for alternative representations that transcend ideological binaries to focus instead in the human ordeal that the Venezuelan exodus entails. Those alternative representations would necessarily oppose the mass-mediatic approach that has so far informed the general view about this ongoing crisis. The resistance to the ideologically-driven regimes of representation that dominate the current debate about the Venezuelan exodus can be attested in artworks like Beatriz Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo;s <i>Zulia, Zulia, Zulia</i> (2015), an oil on canvas that depicts the plight of hundreds of thousands of anonymous immigrants who cross into the Northeastern region of Zulia on the Venezuela-Colombia border. This paper analyses the aesthetic mechanisms through which Gonz&aacute;lez depicts the experience of migrants crossing the border, and argues that the pictorial representation of migration proposed by <i>Zulia, Zulia, Zulia</i> brings to the forefront the notion of crossing as a symbolic constellation that transcends the mere physical act of moving from one territory to another. Ultimately, my paper shows how this artistic approach to exile elicits crucial reflections about the aporias of nationality, assimilation, belonging, and mobility in contemporary Latin America.</p>
