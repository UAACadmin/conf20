			    		<p>From its first appearance, surrealism established itself as an international movement in respect of which no group could claim to exercise a higher ascendancy than others did. While its origins, the French art movement was decidedly an international phenomenon, evidenced by Surrealist art emerging from places as disparate as Mexico and North America. &quot;What is Surrealism in Canada?&quot; specifically explores the topic of surrealism in and of Canada, on which there exists little research. The papers in this panel explore specific examples of how surrealism uniquely took place in Canada, how Canadian artists responded to surrealism, as well as the influence of surrealism on the history of Canadian artists.</p>

			    		<h3>E.7.1 <i>Dr. Grace Pailthorpe and the Seeds of Surrealism in Western Canada</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Melissa Berry</strong><span class="school">, University of Victoria</span></p>
	    				<p>The legacy of Surrealism is labyrinthine in scope and, in its early stages, as it navigated societies effected by global wars and strife, it evolved. Impactful moments of this movement were not always loud &ndash; often they were subtle, quiet, but with enduring effects.  This paper aims to explore such a moment within the realms of visual art through the lens of British artist and doctor Grace Pailthorpe. After being formally expelled from the British Surrealist Group in 1940, Pailthorpe and her partner Reuben Mednikoff travelled first to America then to British Columbia, Canada where they were to have a joint art exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1944. Alongside this exhibition, Pailthorpe gave a series of lectures on Surrealism that greatly impacted visual artists in Western Canada. Shortly after this, the pair returned to England but the impression of their time remained as the Vancouver art community took to Pailthorpe&rsquo;s message of Surrealism with greater vigor than their English-speaking artistic counterparts in Toronto. Exploring Pailthorpe&rsquo;s scientifically-based approach to Surrealism in the visual arts highlights the evolution of this discipline in a part of the world more often associated with conservatism and creates essential translocal links with Canadian Surrealist artists such as Jock MacDonald and Lawren Harris, which have been underexplored in the realms of global Surrealism.</p>

			    		<h3>E.7.2 <i>The Surrealism of Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Miriam Jordan-Haladyn</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
	    				<p>The work of Cowichan/Syilx First Nations artist Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun has consistently been called &lsquo;surrealist&rsquo; because of his imaginative and unconventional use of imagery. While actively denying this connection, he does acknowledge that <i>&ldquo;the visual imagery of Northwest Coast art and belief is itself undeniably surreal</i>.&rdquo; This paper will examine the contemporary surrealism of Yuxweluptun through a discussion of his dialogic treatment of both First Nations and European art histories.</p>

			    		<h3>E.7.3 <i>Are You A Surrealist, Mimi Parent?</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Julian Jason Haladyn</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
	    				<p>Born in Montreal, Mimi Parent became an important contributor to late Surrealism. Her work was featured in many of the final exhibitions, including the 1959 <i>International Surrealist Exhibition</i> in Paris and the 1960 <i>Surrealist Intrusion in the Enchanters’ Domain</i> in New York. Aside from the keen interest of Surrealist scholar Penelope Rosemont, there has been little serious consideration in Parent’s work and role in the late Surrealist movement. This paper will explore a number of her works in relation to the question of Surrealism, drawing upon Parent’s text (published in Rosemont’s book <i>Surrealist Women</i>) &ldquo;Are You a Surrealist?&rdquo;</p>
