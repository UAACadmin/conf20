			    		<p>As knowledge about the geographic scope of photography&rsquo;s past expands and as an increasing number of disciplines begin to incorporate aspects of photography&rsquo;s histories into their own methods of understanding the world, how photography&rsquo;s history should be written becomes a complex and political question. This panel brings together art historians and artists committed to deepening the discourse of photography studies and expanding its points of reference. Potential questions include, how do local practices and histories of photography acknowledge and/or challenge our interconnected &ldquo;globality&rdquo;? How do they complicate dominant narratives? How can a critical history of global photography be imagined? In what ways can art history, visual culture, museum studies, and image making work to decolonize and move away from monolithic timelines and cannons?</p>

			    		<h3>E.3.1 <i>Visual Pedagogies: Decolonizing the History of Photography</i></h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Andrew Gayed</strong><span class="school">, New York University</span></p>
	    				<p>This talk is based on an article titled <i>Visual Pedagogies: Decolonizing and Decentering the History of Photography</i> co-written with Dr. Siobhan Angus and published in Routledge&rsquo;s Studies in Art and Education journal. In it we investigate the structural limits of pedagogy in visual culture and explore decolonizing practices that can be productive to visual studies. Our research seeks to discuss strategies to decolonize the classroom through changes in course structure, assigned texts, and different visual pedagogies that refuse to ghettoize postcolonial historiography and aims to interrogate the very structure of traditional photo history. Building on the critiques of the Eurocentric writing of history, how can we zero-in on the history of photography as a case study to examine the multiple and often contradictory histories available within the global history of art? This paper asks, how is the history of photography currently taught and theorized? Which version of the history of photography is taught in university curriculum and accepted as truth within art historical writing? Can postcolonial narratives co-exist within traditional histories of photography? If so, how can these multiple histories speak to one another productively to uncover a deeper connection between photography as a medium and the subjects within the photographs? Through our methodologies and interventions, we hope to provide diverging new tactics in teaching the significance of visual literacy across disciplines and interrogate systemic racism, gender and sexual discrimination, and religious, and ethnic subjugation through visual pedagogies.</p>
	    				<p>This paper will first provide a traditional overview of photography, highlighting inconsistencies and the complex narratives of intertwined, multi-layered histories. Then I will examine how this history is translated into classrooms and the ways it is taught, theorized, and explored in university settings. This exploration of pedagogy and methodology is followed by an examination of the most common textbooks used to teach the history of photography, and the Eurocentric patterns that reveal themselves in the writing of history. Followed by our own interventions in decentering knowledge and decolonizing historical accounts, I will provide a detailed case study of photography in the Middle East, which will dynamically incorporate studies in the history of photography, critical race theory, and gender and queer studies.</p>

			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Susan Laxton</strong><span class="school">, University of California</span></p>
	    				<p>William Klein has long been categorized as an American street photographer, classed with Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander, and Joel Meyerowitz in their mutual focus on &ldquo;the glorification of the life and rhythms of the street.&rdquo; As is well known, the Japanese &ldquo;Provoke&rdquo; photographers of the late 1960s (Moriyama Daido, Nakahira Takumi, Hosoe Eikoh), on encountering Klein&rsquo;s book on <i>New York, Life is Good and Good for You in New York: Trance, Witness, Revels</i> (1956), modeled their own photographic practice on his &ldquo;rough,&rdquo; &ldquo;blurry,&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of focus&rdquo; &ldquo;anti-photographic&rdquo; style. This relationship, always described in terms of a conventional, one-way, understanding of &ldquo;influence,&rdquo; has thus been characterized as an example of American cultural imperialism that traps these photographs within national boundaries. But Life is Good and Good for You in New York is not an American book at all, but a French one &ndash; steeped in cold war angst, certainly, but not in American exceptionalism. And Japanese photographers, while subjected to American culture in the decades after the war, were already primed for receiving new work from France, based on deep cultural ties there. In rethinking photographic history globally, I propose examining the tri-partite entanglements of French, American and Japanese photographic practices at midcentury, describing a kind of performance-based urban relay between artists in Paris, New York and Tokyo that folded back on itself repeatedly as the actors moved in and out of each-others&rsquo; cultural contexts. Key to my reading of photography&rsquo;s global enmeshment in this cultural skein is Klein&rsquo;s 1961 collaboration with Butoh performer Hijikata Tatsumi, The Crab Dancer&rsquo;s Parade, preserved in more than 600 little-known photographs of near-naked bodies twisting and leaping grotesquely through the open space of the Ginza, an event that reveals these actors&rsquo; complex grasp of the public sphere in its last moments of physical presence.</p>

	    				<p>In this conversation, photography historian Erina Duganne and Korean-born Vancouver-based artist Jin-me Yoon consider Yoon&rsquo;s nearly 30 years of artistic creation. Beginning with her early conceptual-based photographic practice, the discussion will take up how Yoon has used her work to both problematize and subvert stereotypes and assumptions related to gender, maternity, race, culture, and nationality. The conversation will also touch on Yoon&rsquo;s more recent work, in which she turns to video and installation to bear witness to local histories, environments, identities and bodies in the context of entangled and interdependent global relations.</p>
