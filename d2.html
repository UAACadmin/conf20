			    		<p>Covid-19 had us pivot and adapt to new working conditions. Artists are not exempt. Psychically distancing and stay at home directives left some artists without studio or community access. In addition, cultural organizations cancelled events and exhibitions are postponed or moved to a digital format. This roundtable session welcomes submissions from artistic practitioners (including grad students, faculty, sessional instructors and independent artists) with diverse voices and perspectives to discuss ways visual creative practices are and have evolved within this period of uncertainty and change. Panel topics include: Pressures and expectations placed on creative practices, plus strategies artists have adopted in making and disseminating art, including  socially based practices and collaboration.</p>

			    		<p class="bio"><strong>Holly Fay</strong>&rsquo;s research has examined ecology and natural systems, phenomenology, ideas of place, the representation of nature and landscape, the Anthropocene and environmental disquietude. Exhibited nationally and internationally, her artwork is represented in public collections; including the Mackenzie Art Gallery, The Dunlop Art Gallery, City of Regina, and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Permanent Collection. Holly is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Media, Art and Performance at the University of Regina, teaching painting, drawing and professional practice, she holds an MFA from the University of Ulster in Belfast, Northern Ireland and a BFA from the University of Regina.</p>
			    		<p class="bio"><strong>Sean Whalley</strong> teaches sculpture in the Faculty of Media, Art, and Performance at the University of Regina and is currently the MAP Associate Dean (Undergraduate). Between a BFA from York University and an MFA at the University of Regina, Sean studied the old-world technologies of blacksmithing and coopering. Given his interest in obsolete technologies, nostalgia and displacement play a primary role in the narratives he explores. Sean utilizes discarded/recycled materials for the bulk of his work in an attempt to realize a sustainable practice. Part of his teaching philosophy focuses on community development and encouraging students to realize their art practice beyond the classroom.</p>
