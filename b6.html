			    		<p>The digital turn in the Humanities and Art History runs the risk of accentuating the already marginal position of Islamic art history in the academy, particularly in Canada. This session presents an overview of the digital art history research collective (<i>darc</i>) by the chair and a series of experimental approaches by <i>darc</i>’s current members that can be used to practice alternate kinds of art history of the pre-modern Persianate Islamic world and beyond. Presenters will discuss scholarly remediations of miniature paintings using 3D printing, how digital media can be used to critically narrate and interrogate UNESCO’s construction of Iranian architectural heritage and how data visualizations can be used to provide alternative perspectives on artistic collaboration and choices. Together these experiments explore what Digital Art History can be, while illuminating what Digital Islamic Art History cannot be due to entrenched inequities.</p>

			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Ahlam Bavi</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
	    				<p>Museums and art galleries have come a long way in accommodating differently-abled guests and facilitating their experience of art. Nowadays, assistive devices have been improved and signing tours are commonly offered for the deaf in museums. Strategies for low-vision visitors, such as the development of tactile replicas (i.e. re-mediations) of original artworks, have also been introduced. However, these remain underdeveloped, particularly when it comes to Islamicate art collections, and there is much room for improvement. Low-vision and visually impaired people must rely on their other senses, such as touch, to experience the world around them. How can museum visitors touch valuable and unique artworks? This study aims to develop solutions for low-vision visitors by designing a 3D Toolkit. We generate a series of 3D tools and remediations of artworks, which include tactile 3D-printed models, Tactile Diagram Cuboid, Tactile Puzzle Cube, Orientation Cube, and Information Cube to make artworks more accessible for low-vision and visually impaired museum visitors. We have developed a pilot project to explore how Islamicate Art collections can be made more accessible to low-vision visitors.</p>

			    		<h3>B.6.2 Using Digital Media to Interrogate UNESCO’s Approach to Iranian Architectural Heritage</h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Sepideh Saffari</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
	    				<p>This paper discusses the initial stages of my study of UNESCO&rsquo;s role in the construction of Iranian national identity through the representation of architectural heritage. While UNESCO believes that peace is based on dialogue and mutual understanding among nations, it does not sufficiently promote the cross-cultural influences nations have on each other, particularly in its representations of visual culture. I argue UNESCO&rsquo;s approach obscures the deeply transnational nature of Iranian architectural heritage. To demonstrate my argument, I employ a visual-centric methodology based on examples such as <i>Unflattening</i>, a visual dissertation created by Nick Sousanis. I use this methodology to challenge the conventional forms of scholarly discourse in order to offer a visual argument as form of serious discussion. Although Sousanis did not use multimedia to express his ideas, a digital platform provides a more flexible and dynamic environment that can be used to more effectively convey visual arguments. In this sense, I will also explore how digital media in the form of intellectual game mediate our interpretation of architectural heritage interactions in the Aga Khan Garden web-app as a case study. To be more precise, I investigate the transcultural conversation among Aga Khan Garden, Historic Persian and Mughal built heritage.</p>

			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Yasaman Lotfizadeh</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
	    				<p>The increasing availability of sophisticated digital tools today allows researchers and practitioners alike to explore visual art in new ways. Never before has there been the facility to analyze the complex and deep connections within substantial bodies of work across time and artistic groups. These tools increase the speed of analysis and bring to the foreground the minutia of details that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. The current study investigates the extent of artistic collaboration in one deluxe Persian illustrated manuscript, the Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh (also Shahnama) paintings. The study outlines a Social Network Analysis and the use of Digital Humanities tools and methods to analyze the patterns of artistic collaboration among the various artists who worked on this manuscript under Shah Tahmasp's patronage. Revealing the network of relationships within the previously disregarded Shahnameh artists will create a richer understanding of the topology of the collaborative process these artists worked with. This study can help change the understanding of the royal workshop composition and how the paintings were illustrated in the Safavid period. It also raises the question, does the application of a new lens - or a different mediation - on the same material such as Social Network Analysis, yield results of significance for visual historiographical research?</p>
