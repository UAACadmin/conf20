			    		<p>This two-part session invites BIPOC and White Settler scholars, artists and curators into dialogue concerning the ways artistic production interjects disturbance into contemporary colonial landscapes transnationally. A geography of colonial ideology overlays all aspects of contemporary life in nations and bodies impacted by settler colonialism. This extends from normative conceptions of place and identity within the settler society to the calcified institutional administrative cultures that shape engagement with, and the production of, knowledge. The arts and cultural sector has been complicit in establishing and maintaining dominant imaginaries and structures that sustain these sometimes painful ideological landscapes. Simultaneously, cultural workers are often instrumental in subverting them. Through a discussion of specific artworks, the roundtable participants will consider how artistic interventions mobilize &ldquo;radical defamiliarization&rdquo; (States 2010, 35) as a strategy for disturbing colonial whiteness and asserting unremitting Indigenous sovereignties in the land, the gallery and iconic national sites.</p>

	    				<p class="bio"><strong>Deanna Bowen</strong> (b. 1969, Oakland; lives in Toronto) is a descendant of two Alabama and Kentucky born Black Prairie pioneer families from Amber Valley and Campsie, Alberta. Bowen’s family history has been the central pivot of her auto-ethnographic interdisciplinary works since the early 1990s. She makes use of a repertoire of artistic gestures in order to define the Black body and trace its presence and movement in place and time. In recent years, her work has involved close examination of her family’s migration and their connections to Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Black Strathcona, the “All-Black” towns of Oklahoma, the Kansas Exoduster migrations and the Ku Klux Klan in Canada and the US. She is a recipient of a 2020 Governor General Award for Visual and Media Arts Award, a 2018 Canada Council Research and Creation Grant, an Ontario Arts Council Media Arts Grant in 2017, a 2016 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, and the 2014 William H. Johnson Prize. Her writing, interviews and artworks have been published in <i>Canadian Art</i>, <i>The Capilano Review</i>, <i>The Black Prairie Archives</i>, and <i>Transition Magazine</i>. Bowen is editor of the 2019 publication <i>Other Places: Reflections on Media Arts in Canada</i>.</p>
