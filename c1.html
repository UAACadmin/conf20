			    		<p>Since Dada, artists have been fascinated with ephemera, self-consciously accumulating stuff as the raw material of their work in photography, collage, mail art, cinema, video, installation, and performance. Pop, Fluxus, Conceptual Art have reflected, fetishized, and critiqued the flood of print and consumer culture in technological societies. Their own collections come to light when artists reach a certain age and begin to think of this amassment as an archive.</p> 
			    		<p>What happens when these collections enter the public sphere? Or more precisely, what has happened, since there are numerous examples of artist&rsquo;s or artist-collectives&rsquo; archives become fonds and housed in special collections, museum archives, and other institutions. Vincent Bonin has examined this shift, as has Artexte in its artists&rsquo; and curatorial residencies. Where else has this been going on? We are interested in the stories that such archives have been allowed to tell, and the counter-narratives that the translation from private to public has disallowed.</p>

			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Hatty Nestor</strong><span class="school">, Birkbeck College</span></p>
	    				<p>Mendieta’s 1981 poem <i>Pain of Cuba, Body I am</i> marks Mendieta&rsquo;s ontological displacement, conveyed through what Simek Shropshire has called &lsquo;the presence of linguistic dexis&rsquo; (2017). Linguistically and tangibly, Mendieta&rsquo;s work consistently refers to her exile from Cuba; her re-location both physically and subjectively. Theories of Latinidad proposed by Mar&iacute;a Rodr&iacute;guez (2003), and Maria Ant&ograve;nia (2015) mark the diaspora bound to what Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz&rsquo;s denotes as &lsquo;vitalisms afterburn of browness&rsquo;&nbsp;(2011), to map Mendieta&rsquo;s subjectivity as an exiled woman from Cuba to the United States. On Mendieta&rsquo;s (1980) return to Cuba, she created the Rupestrian sculptures (1982) in Jaruco State Park in Havana, Artist Elise Rasmuseens, and scholar Jose Quiroga (2005) sought to find them, yet the traces of her mark-making in the land remain in the cultural imagination. Drawing on debates in posed by Alvarado (2018), Oliver-Rotger (2015) and Hyacinthe (2019) I situate the spatial, temporal and embodied meditation Mendieta presents in these pieces through theories of the Latinidad, asking wider questions of not just ontological displacement, but as a woman who reclaimed her agency through mark-making in the land.</p>
	    				<p>I am interested precisely in the tension between these efforts to locate Mendieta, and what is lost, distilled and re-found in the political decision to reject Mendieta as a subject formed through an act of violence, and the subject formation that such violence might generate. Mendieta&rsquo;s death, allegedly by her husband Carl Andre, beckons the question: where does mortality prevail when seeking for a resolution in these undeniably fraught images? Or as a form of subversion, ungraspable beyond our idea of subjecthood? I intend to use examples from the archive to uncover such questions. I argue that to comprehend Mendieta &ndash; or even who or what or where we might be considering in uttering her name &ndash; is to acknowledge that she is often still bound to negative rhetoric associated directly to her (supposed) murder as a woman exiled from Cuba.</p>

	    				<p>My research analyzes the archive as a malleable tool for art making. Inspired by Francis Ponge&rsquo;s &ldquo;description-definitions&rdquo; and Gertrude Stein&rsquo;s idea of the prolonged present, I created a personal archive of concepts for images from which to build all my subsequent work. Used in this way, the archival form becomes the foundation for storytelling and poetry, subverting the idea that the archive is something statically formal, bureaucratic or paramount to its anarchival by-products. My paper discusses how an autoethnographic and poetic approach to the archive can create an evolving network, where meaning is continually wrapped around the archive and the artwork through a non-hierarchical gathering of symbols materials, text and images. As a foundational text for my studio practice, this archive is a living document that changes each time it is put to
	use. It is both a long form poem and a creative manifesto that lends itself to play-based exploration and self-discovery.</p>

			    		<h3>C.1.3 <i>Erotic Fever in the Archive: Imagining a queer porn paradise in Hazel Meyer and Cait McKinney’s exhibition</i> Tape Condition: degraded</h3>
			    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Genevieve Flavelle</strong><span class="school">, Queen’s University</span></p>
	    				<p>This paper examines historian Cait McKinney and artist Hazel Meyer&rsquo;s exhibition <i>Tape Condition: degraded</i>, an intervention in Canada&rsquo;s largest LGBTQ archive the ArQuives in Toronto, Ontario. I argue that the exhibition makes a compelling case for porn as a vital historical record of queer pleasure and art as an avenue through which absences in historical representation can be rectified. Meyer and McKinney&rsquo;s exhibition began with a zealous two-year search through the ArQuives&rsquo;s unusual collection of over 800 porn VHS tapes for a video featuring women, trans folks, people of colour, and/or performers with non-normative bodies. They found nothing. However, through their encounter with this absence, the couple&rsquo;s archive fever was supplanted by erotic fever as they began to fantasize about not only their dream tapes, but the different kind of archive that might contain them, a multifunctional space for watching, digitizing, fantasizing, and getting off. In 2016, Meyer and McKinney fully realized their imagined archive as the installation <i>Tape Condition: degraded</i> at the ArQuives. The innovative exhibition &ndash; equal parts archive, digitization suite, pervy queer sex zone, and community recreation room &ndash; activated embodied, erotic, and imaginative responses to the archive as a repository of knowledge, as well as a site of pleasure, fantasy and activism. The exhibition created a necessary intervention in the gay male bias of the archives&rsquo; holdings and engaged the community in addressing its absences through creative and speculative strategies.</p>
